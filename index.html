					Seaweeds resemble some common plant features such as roots, stems, and leaves, however are not closely related at all. 
					The whole body of seaweed is called the thallus, the base which resembles roots is called the holdfast, the structure 
					which resembles a stem is called stipe, and what look like leaves are referred to as blades, and in addition seaweeds 
					have a flotation adaptation element called a pneumonia. There are 3 main seaweed groups; green algae, brown algae, red 
					algae, and flowering plants which include; seagreasses, salt marsh plants, and mangroves.

						Pneumatocysts are the gas filled bladder like structures of seaweeds, these are responsible for 
						keeping the blades near the top of the water surface to maximize photosynthesis opportunities.

						At the base of seaweeds, is the root-like structure called the holdfast,

						They are unable to attach to loose soft sediment bottoms for a rick of wave disruption.
